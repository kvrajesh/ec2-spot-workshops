### Running the workshop self-paced, in your own AWS account


To complete this workshop, have access to an AWS account with administrative permissions. An IAM user with administrator access (**arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess**) will do nicely.

Once you are done with either setup, continue to the [**Setup with CloudFormation**](/ecs-spot-capacity-providers/WorkshopSetup/launch_cloudformation.html). If you need an introduction to containers, Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate, continue to the [**Introduction section.**](/ecs-spot-capacity-providers/introduction.html)

To avoid unwanted costs in your account, don't forget to go through the [**Cleanup step**](/ecs-spot-capacity-providers/cleanup.html) when you finish the workshop, or if you deploy the CloudFormation template but don't complete the workshop.
