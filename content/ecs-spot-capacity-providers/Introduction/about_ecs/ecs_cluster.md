Amazon ECS cluster
---
<p style="text-align: justify;">
An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services.
<br>
If you are running tasks or services that use the EC2 launch type, a cluster is also a grouping of container instances.
<br>
If you are using capacity providers, a cluster is also a logical grouping of capacity providers.
A Cluster can be a combination of Fargate and EC2 launch types.
<br>
When you first use Amazon ECS, a default cluster is created for you, but you can create multiple clusters in an account to keep your resources separate.
