***What is a Container?***
--------------------------

![Container Ship](/images/ecs-spot-capacity-providers/containership.jpg)

* Containers provide a standard way to package your applicationâ€™s code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object.

* Containers share an operating system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes, ensuring quick, reliable, and consistent deployments, regardless of environment.
* Whether you deploy locally on your laptop or to production, the experience will remain the same (with the exception of secrets and other environmental values, of course!).
